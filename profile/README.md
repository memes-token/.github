## About Memes Token

Memes Token is a unique Ethereum-based token that powers our decentralized applications, including our flagship DApp, Banterr. Designed for the community, Memes Token aims to revolutionize the way we interact with memes and social media.

### Banterr

[Banterr](https://banterr.app) is our innovative decentralized application (DApp) that offers users a unique experience in meme sharing and social interaction. Banterr combines decentralized and centralized components. It utilizes IPFS for efficient and secure file sharing, while leveraging blockchain technology for creating and awarding PostNFTs.
